### Howdy Web Traveller 🤠

⚙️ I'm currently working with [DataX](https://github.com/dataxfi), building [Datax.js](https://github.com/dataxfi/datax.js), [Datapolis](https://www.datapolis.city/), and other Data Defi projects. 

🌱 I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge in front end applicaitions, web3.js, and want to learn solidity as well.
